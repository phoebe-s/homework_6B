Cannot test: HTML validator loads with error (-2 pts)
  Fixed all errors with 6B submission.
  
Cannot test: CSS validator loads with error (-2 pts) 
  There was no error when I checked the CSS validator for my 6A submission. 6B submission should not have errors.

Cannot test: JS page description (-2 pts) 
Cannot test: Cart indicator (-1.25 pts) 
Cannot test: Interactions load with an error
  Not sure if one of these comments was referring to the broken image link which I fixed in my 6B submission. However, the 6A shopping cart was functional in that when you add an item to the cart, the item is stored and can be seen when you click on my cart. I added a live item count in the 6B submission to make it more clear.


** OTHER NOTES **
Added live calculation for subtotal and grand total in the shopping cart.
Added carousel for recommended items below the product description in the product page.
